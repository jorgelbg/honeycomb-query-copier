**honeycomb-query-copier** is an experimental Google Chrome extension that adds a copy button next to the
[Query Builder](https://docs.honeycomb.io/working-with-your-data/queries/) form. Clicking this button
will copy the `WHERE` clauses present in the current query as [Derived Column
Syntax](https://docs.honeycomb.io/working-with-your-data/customizing-your-query/derived-columns/#derived-column-syntax).

Operators are translated from the Query Builder representation into [their functional
equivalent](https://docs.honeycomb.io/working-with-your-data/customizing-your-query/derived-columns/reference/#function-reference----omit-in-toc---).
Keep in mind that there are advanced functions/operators that cannot be used from the query builder but can be part
of a Derived Column definition. Those especial cases (like `CONCAT`) would still need to be added
using the provided editor when creating/editing the Derived Column.

A query like this in the Query Builder:

```js
meta.annotation_type does-not-exist
trace.parent_id does-not-exist
http.method in GET, POST
```

gets transformed into:

```js
AND(NOT(EXISTS($meta.annotation_type)),NOT(EXISTS($trace.parent_id)),
IN($http.method, "GET","POST"))
```

which can be pasted into the Derived Column editor.
